# leaflet-challenge

This challenge focuses on visualizing the earthquake data on a map using leaflet plug in. Data was pulled from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS. The dataset is focused on the last 7 days of data. 

Using the leaflet, a map was created to plot all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude. Different functions were created for the popups for on each marker, markersize, and marker color that would be added to the createMap function. Baselayers were pulled from the openstreetmap resource/library. And the overlay objects/maps are created from the earthquakes function.

Much of the code was derived from the Week 15, Day 1, Activity 10 file. Additional code, such as the create legend function was derived from the Leaflet documentation (chloropleth).
